Jaccard similarity relies purely on exact word overlap and performs poorly when synonyms are used. WordNet-based similarity captures meaning better by using semantic relationships. Lexical methods fail when different words convey the same meaning. Semantic similarity excels in understanding conceptual similarity but is limited to word-level comparisons. Scores often disagree when texts share meaning but not vocabulary. Jaccard is the most brittle method. Cosine similarity is widely applicable, while WordNet is useful for deeper semantic analysis."
